**Senior Software Developer & Tech Lead | PHP, Laravel, Vue.js | Performance, Architecture & AI-Driven Development**

# Summary

For over 15 years, my career has been driven by a central challenge: how to make complex systems faster, more efficient, and more secure. As a Tech Lead and Senior Developer, my answer lies in combining robust software architecture, relentless performance optimization, and leadership that empowers teams to deliver their best work.

Instead of just talking about "improvements," I prefer to focus on concrete results. At Turno, for example, I dove into performance bottlenecks and, through strategic refactoring and query optimization, reduced endpoint response times by 40%. At Evoke Mobile, I redesigned a queue processing system to make it 500x faster. It's not just about the code, but the impact it generates.

My leadership approach is practical: I've led teams in delivering critical domains, strengthened application security, and increased the reliability of CI/CD pipelines by resolving over 100 unstable tests. I believe innovation is a daily practice, which is why I integrated AI tools (like GitHub Copilot) into my teams' development workflow to boost productivity and code quality.

I seek opportunities where I can collaborate with teams that value technical excellence, transparent communication, and the continuous pursuit of optimization. Let's build something scalable together.
